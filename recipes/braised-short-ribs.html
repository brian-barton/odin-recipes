    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 pounds meaty bone-in short ribs <em>1 1/2 inches or thicker</em></li>
      <li>2 tablespoons kosher salt <em>divided</em></li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
      <li>6 medium carrots <em>chopped (about 3 cups)</em></li>
      <li>4 ribs celery <em>chopped (about 3 cups)</em></li>
      <li>1 medium onion <em>chopped</em></li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic <em>minced (about 2 tablespoons)</em></li>
      <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>
        1 bottle (750 ml) dry red wine
        <em>such as Chianti, cabernet sauvignon, or Cotes de Rhone</em>
      </li>
      <li>4 cups beef stock or chicken stock <em>plus more as needed</em></li>
      <li>1 (14-ounce) can fire roasted diced tomatoes in their juices</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme <em>tied into a bundle with kitchen string</em></li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/4 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Pat the short ribs dry, then season generously all over with 5
        teaspoons salt and 1 teaspoon pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large Dutch oven or similar large, sturdy-bottomed, oven-safe pot with a cover (I
        used a 5.5-quart Dutch oven) over medium-high heat (you don't need to add any oil). Add
        about half of the short ribs in a single layer, making sure they are not touching one
        another (if the pan is too crowded, they won't brown properly). Sear on all sides until they
        are deeply browned, about 6 to 8 minutes per batch. Transfer the short ribs to a large
        baking dish that can catch any juices. Repeat with remaining short ribs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully discard all but about 2 tablespoons fat from the pot. Reduce the heat to medium
        and add the carrots, celery, onion, remaining 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
        Cook, stirring every so often, until the vegetables are tender and beginning to caramelize,
        about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scoot the vegetables to one side to create an open space in the pan. Add the tomato paste
        and stir vigorously for 30 seconds, then stir the paste into the vegetables to combine. Stir
        in the garlic and cook 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the wine (be careful as it will splatter), and using a wooden spoon or sturdy spatula,
        scrape up any browned bits that have collected on the pan. Bring the wine to a boil, then
        reduce the heat to a simmer. Let simmer until the wine is reduced by approximately half,
        about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in the stock, tomatoes, Worcestershire, Dijon, thyme bundle, and oregano.</li>
      <li>
        Nestle the short ribs into the pot, along with any cooking liquid that has collected in the
        pot.
      </li>
      <li>Bring the liquid in the pot to a boil. Cover the pot then transfer to the oven.</li>
      <li>Bake the short ribs in the oven, covered, for 1 hour.</li>
      <li>
        Remove the lid, then continue baking, uncovered, for 1 hour more, until the meat is
        fall-apart tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        With a slotted spoon, carefully remove the short ribs to a large plate. Check the pot for
        any bones that have separated from the meat and discard. Fish out and discard the thyme
        bundle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return the pot to the stove and bring the liquid to a simmer. Let simmer for 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        With a large spoon, skim off some of the fat from the sauce (you won't be able to get it
        all; just spoon off what you can). Return the short ribs to the sauce and heat to warm
        through for 5 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve hot with mashed potatoes or oven roasted
        potatoes, papardelle, or cooked polenta.
      </li>
    </ol>
