    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pan-seared Lamb Chops have a flavorful garlic and herb crust with a juicy and tender center. These holiday-worthy lamb chops are simple and excellent!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs lamb rib chops, 8 count, <em>cut from a rack of Frenched lamb ribs</em></li>
        <li>5 plump garlic cloves, <em>pressed</em></li>
        <li>4 Tbsp olive oil, <em>divided</em></li>
        <li>2 Tbsp fresh parsley, plus more for garnish <em>(or use 2 tsp dried parsley)</em></li>
        <li>2 tsp Tabasco original red pepper sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp fine sea salt, <em>we used sea salt</em></li>
        <li>1 tsp black pepper, <em>freshly ground</em></li>
        <li>1/4 tsp dried thyme</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Thoroughly pat lamb chops dry with paper towels, wiping away any possible bone fragments or shards. Slice between ribs to separate chops, cutting into 3/4″ or 1″ thick even portions.</li>
        <li>Stir together marinade ingredients in a measuring cup: 5 pressed garlic cloves, 3 Tbsp olive oil, 2 Tbsp parsley, 2 tsp Tabasco, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp pepper and 1/4 tsp thyme.</li>
        <li>Place lamb chops in a non-reactive casserole dish, pour over the marinade, and rub all sides of lamb chops (focusing on meaty portions) with marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove lamb chops from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking. Place a large heavy pan over high heat and add 1 Tbsp oil. Once the oil is hot, add chops and sear for 2-4 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of chops and desired doneness on a thermometer; keep in mind temp rises 5 degrees as it rests (see notes). Sautee in 2 batches if needed. Transfer to a serving plate, tent with foil, and rest for 5 minutes while making the pan sauce.</li>
    </ol>
