# Odin Recipes

I am building a simple recipe website using only HTML, with a future update to include CSS. This project is apart of The Odin Project's "Foundations" course. Once I have completed this project it will demonstrate the skills I have learned so far. 

Some of the skills that will be demonstrated are:

- Knowledge of the basic structure or boilerplate of HTML documents
- Use of common HTML elements and their associated attributes, such as:
    - Headings 
    ```htm
    <h1>...</h1>, <h2>...</h2>, <h3>...</h3>, etc.
    ```
    - Paragraphs 
    ```htm
    <p>...</p>
    ```
    - Bold and Italicized text 
    ```htm
    <strong>...</strong>, <em>...</em>
    ```
    - Ordered and Unordered lists 
    ```htm
    <ol>             <ul>
      <li>...</li>     <li>...</li>  
    <ol>             </ul>
    ```
    - Links and Images 
    ```htm
    <a href="absolute or relative path">...</a> <img src="absolute or relative path">
    ```
- Proficiency in writing good commit messages following the rule of doing atomic commits

I will come back to this after the project has been completed to do a self-reflection on anything else I may have learned.
